Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Java Software Developer position at Finanz Informatik GmbH & Co. KG, based in Hannover. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Berlin and over nine years of experience in software development, I believe I possess the necessary skills and enthusiasm to contribute effectively to your team.

In my previous role at Tech Solutions GmbH, I was responsible for backend development, API design, and database optimisation using Java and Spring Boot, which aligns well with your requirement for strong professional experience in Java and JavaScript. My proficiency with tools such as Git and Maven and my experience in frontend development with React will enable me to work effectively on your diverse and innovative projects. Additionally, my certification as an Oracle Certified Professional in Java SE 11 demonstrates my commitment to maintaining a high level of technical expertise.

I am particularly drawn to the role at Finanz Informatik because of the opportunity to participate in innovative software development and take responsibility for complex projects. My ability to work independently, coupled with a structured and goal-oriented approach, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to quality assurance and performance optimisation efforts. Furthermore, my keen interest in teamwork and technical challenges resonates well with your organisational culture that values curiosity and collaboration.

I am excited about the possibility of joining Finanz Informatik, a leader in digital banking services, where I can apply my analytical skills and technical proficiency to solve complex problems and deliver high-quality solutions. I am enthusiastic about bringing my unique blend of skills and experience to your team and contributing to the exciting digitalisation projects at your company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the continued success of Finanz Informatik GmbH & Co. KG.

Yours sincerely,

Max Mustermann
